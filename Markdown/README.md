#### The Recipe
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
  Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.
  If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
  Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.  
  By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.

4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.  
   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

   * Make sure no trout or children are present
   * Use both hands
   * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes
   
Use ``` for multiple line code  
```
if(true) {
  print("Hello World")
}
```
